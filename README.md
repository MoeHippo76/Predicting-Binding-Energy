# Predicting-Binding-Energy
Statistical analysis of DFT and Hosphe 2.0. 

Monte Carlo Parameters are all generated by `parameter_generator.py`. This script is imported in the `run_box1.py` and `run_box3.py` to produce parameter sets. This script is also imported by `evaluating event generator/eval_event_generator.py` to evalute the monte carlo event generator. Scatter plot representation of correlation table and distribution plots are also stored and generated here. 

### Before running any of the scripts-
If using gfortran compiler use, gfortran-5, especially for box 3 in the make files.

Add the following lines in the start of `VSLAT/1_dft/run.sh` 
`
cd src
make clean
make
cd .. `

Make sure to change the functional to UNE1 and change the default value of `test` to false. 


Change root directory as needed in 3 of the pythons files for the scripts to find VSLAT. Go to `__main__` to change parameters root and save location. Change the different flags to reuse parameter sets or to only visualize without rerunning VSLAT.  

`run_box1.py` varies parameters and only runs box 1. All Output is stored in `box1_output/dft_<element>_<Nosc> ` for eg `dft_Mg24_4`. Produces distribution of ground state and a band of dft.

`run_box3.py` only varies box 1 parameters but runs upto box 3. All output is stored in `box3_output/chi_<element>_<Nosc>`. Produces a distribution of int_strength and a band of fit anf dft. varying Box 2 parameters is needed.

`linearization.py` Produces derivatives and calculates standard deviation follwing Tia's thesis. Since the values do not match Tia's phd thesis, code is buggy and needs to be checked or redone.

Data from All non standard runs, like only parameter sets under 10 percent of 1 standard deviation, and with pairing is stored in `other box1 data`.

The `evaluate_parameters.ods` sheets file is to manually analyse a generated parameter set.
